            Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are 
            unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short. Wild junglefowl can fly; 
            chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a 
            short distance. Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[18] Adult chickens 
            of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and 
            hanging flaps of skin on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and
            wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra 
            feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.</p>

            People have eaten the flesh of bovines since prehistoric times; some of the 
            earliest known cave paintings, such as those of Lascaux, show aurochs in hunting 
            scenes. People domesticated cattle to provide ready access to beef, milk, and 
            leather. Cattle have been domesticated at least twice over the course of 
            evolutionary history. The first domestication event occurred around 10,500 years 
            ago with the evolution of Bos taurus. The second was more recent, around 7,000
            years ago, with the evolution of Bos indicus in the Indian subcontinent. There 
            is a possible third domestication event 8,500 years ago, with a potential third
            species Bos africanus arising in Africa.</p>

            A dish known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司, "matured fish"), stored in fermented rice 
            for possibly months at a time, has been cited as one of the early influences for the 
            Japanese practice of applying rice on raw fish. The fish was fermented with rice vinegar,
            salt, and rice, after which the rice was discarded.[6] Narezushi is also called honnare, 
            meaning "fully fermented", as opposed to namanare, meaning "partially fermented", a type 
            of sushi that appeared in the Muromachi period.</p>
