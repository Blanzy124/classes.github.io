        <section class="c ft">Chicken</section>
        Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are 
        unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short. Wild junglefowl can fly; 
        chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a 
        short distance. Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[18] Adult chickens 
        of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and 
        hanging flaps of skin on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and
        wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra 
        feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.

        <section class="b ft">Beef</section>
        People have eaten the flesh of bovines since prehistoric times; some of the 
        earliest known cave paintings, such as those of Lascaux, show aurochs in hunting 
        scenes. People domesticated cattle to provide ready access to beef, milk, and 
        leather. Cattle have been domesticated at least twice over the course of 
        evolutionary history. The first domestication event occurred around 10,500 years 
        ago with the evolution of Bos taurus. The second was more recent, around 7,000
        years ago, with the evolution of Bos indicus in the Indian subcontinent. There 
        is a possible third domestication event 8,500 years ago, with a potential third
        species Bos africanus arising in Africa.

        <section class="s ft">Sushi</section>
        A dish known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司, "matured fish"), stored in fermented rice 
        for possibly months at a time, has been cited as one of the early influences for the 
        Japanese practice of applying rice on raw fish. The fish was fermented with rice vinegar,
        salt, and rice, after which the rice was discarded.[6] Narezushi is also called honnare, 
        meaning "fully fermented", as opposed to namanare, meaning "partially fermented", a type 
        of sushi that appeared in the Muromachi period.
